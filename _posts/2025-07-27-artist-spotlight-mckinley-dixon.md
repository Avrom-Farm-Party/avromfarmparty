“REJOICE!” commands McKinley Dixon on his sophomore LP, _Magic, Alive!_ Mixing hip-hop, jazz, and soul, his songs tell deep, powerful stories about love, grief, community, and growing up. His 2023 album _Beloved! Paradise! Jazz!?_ was named one of the best of the year by places like Pitchfork and NPR, and for good reason. It’s emotional, bold, and totally unique.

Now, he’s back with _Magic, Alive_, a brand-new record that keeps pushing his sound even further. It's full of big feelings, sharp lyrics, and the kind of music that makes you stop and really listen.

Live, McKinley Dixon brings it all to the stage: a full band, electric energy, and the kind of honesty that pulls you in. We’re so excited to welcome him to Avrom Farm Party, and this is a set you won’t want to miss.
